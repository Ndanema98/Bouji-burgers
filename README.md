# Milestone project 4
# 

[""]() is a programme designed to .

This programme was built for a company which sells Jordan trainers. It will allow the user to input the monthly sales data of a specific trainer and add it to a google spreadsheet. The programme will also provide the user with data such as the month that sold the most shoes, the average amount of shoes sold in a particular month and the shoe that sold the most. Different validation methods are also present throughtout this programme to check whether the data being inputted is valid.

Spreadsheets are a great way to store data for companies because it allows them to organise and perform calculations on the data. This enables them to make important predictions and decisions, which on a whole willb benefit them. 

This programme was built using knowledge gained from Python modules, for the purpose of completing my third Milestone Project for the Code Institute's full stack developer course. This programme is easy to navigate and easy to read, with a clear goal and aim.
